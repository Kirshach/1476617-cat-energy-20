# “Cat energy” company landing mock-up 

Adaptive vanilla HTML/SCSS mock-up consisting of three pages, [index](https://kirshach.github.io/cat-energy/index.html), [catalog](https://kirshach.github.io/cat-energy/catalog.html) and [subscription form](https://kirshach.github.io/cat-energy/form.html) (nevermind form validation ux tho, it's wrong by now)
